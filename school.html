                    The school, which is situated on the edge of Himeville village at the foothills of the Southern
                    Drakensberg Mountains, offers tuition from Grade 1 to Grade 12
                </p>

                <p>
                    Faithway College was founded in 1994 by a group of families who wanted an education based on
                    Christian principles for their children. Accordingly, they founded the school attached to the
                    Highlands Church. Soon afterwards it separated from the Highlands Church, and was able to purchase a
                    portion of the farm Riversdale from the insolvent estate of Allen Robertson, just large enough to
                    erect school buildings and have a number of playing fields. It now has a Foundation Phase building,
                    an Intermediate Phase School building and a High School building
                </p>

                <p>
                    From these small beginnings Faithway has developed into a school which has been able to achieve
                    outstanding results in the educational field. We offer tuition from grade 1 – 12. Faithway follows
                    the syllabus and curriculum requirements of the KwaZulu-Natal Education Department with whom it is
                    registered and we write the National Senior Certificate Matric exam . All the major core subjects
                    are offered as well as a range of specialised subjects such as Agricultural science and Consumer
                    Studies, both of which are in demand in our district . Instruction is given in English, and English
                    is taken at a Home Language level. Afrikaans and isiZulu are offered at a First Additional Language
                    level. We are members of ISASA and fully accredited with UMALUSI
                </p>

                <p>
                    We consistently achieve 100% pass rate in the Matric exams and are often awarded the trophy for the
                    top achieving school in the district . A high proportion of our pupils have gained a university
                    entrance pass In addition to our excellent matric pass rate, with many Bachelor Passes, learners
                    have participated in Olympiads, Art and Essay Competitions with many achieving outstanding results.
                    Learners have received scholarships to attend various prestigious schools and academies, such as,
                    the Simon’s Town Naval Academy and Northwood. One learner received a scholarship for Masters in
                    Anthropology at Oxford, whilst in 2018 we had the top matriculant in the entire district who went on
                    to study psychology on a full bursary. We also had the privilege of teaching the youngest graduate
                    of Spar Management Academy. This is just the tip of the iceberg. We have university students and
                    graduates excelling in the fields of Politics, Law, Journalism, Actuarial Sciences, Medicine and
                    Education
                </p>

                <p>
                    The small numbers in each age group, together with our rural location, have made it difficult to
                    compete with schools in academic, cultural and sporting activities. Despite this, our learners and
                    educators have risen to the challenge, and have participated and excelled in a wide range of
                    activities such as Choir, Debate, chess, rugby, soccer, cricket, netball and hockey. We also offer
                    Archery as a sport. In the fields of sport and culture our learners excel, receiving District and
                    Sisonke colours in athletics. A number have been invited to participate in Sisonke hockey. We have
                    had 2 cricketers and 1 rugby player participating at the SALGA games. On the cultural scene Faithway
                    has received a number of awards over the years for both Choir and Debating. We have a learner
                    winning the Ghandi essay competition, and others being published by the Poetry Institute of South
                    Africa. Students have been selected to attend Rotary Leadership camps, become exchange students to
                    Germany and to address the government as part of the Children’s Parliament
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the school grows more parents in the district are coming to realise that it is no longer
                    necessary to send their children away to boarding school because there is a fully functioning high
                    school with a sound academic record on their doorstep. It is a place where each boy or girl is
                    encouraged to strive to reach his or her full potential, not only in the academic sphere but also in
                    a wide range of cultural and sporting activities. We also try to inculcate civic awareness so that
                    everyone learns to care for others and to show compassion for those in need. A large number of our
                    own pupils fall into that last category themselves having experienced our harsh life can be after
                    the loss of both parents.
                </p>

                <p>Faithway is a friendly, happy school where there is structure, discipline and order with a good
                    rapport between staff and pupils</p>
