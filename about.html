                    The school, which is situated on the edge of Himeville village at the foothills of the Southern
                    Drakensberg Mountains, offers tuition from Grade 1 to Grade 12.

                    Faithway College was born and founded in 1992 by a group of families who wanted an education based
                    on Christian principles for their children. Accordingly, they founded the school attached to the
                    Highlands
                    Church. Soon afterwards it separated from the Highlands Church, and was able to purchase a portion
                    of the farm
                    Riversdale from the insolvent estate of Allen Robertson, just large enough to erect school buildings
                    and have a
                    number of playing fields. It now has a Junior School building and a High School building.

                </p>
                <p>
                    From these small beginnings Faithway has developed into a normal academic school which has been able
                    to achieve outstanding results in the educational field. At the moment the enrolment is 74 in the
                    Primary
                    School and 62 in the High School. There are currently17 full time teachers and 5 part time teachers
                    on the staff. The
                    pupils reflect the average numbers of the population groups of the country. Faithway follows the
                    syllabus
                    and curriculum requirements of the KwaZulu-Natal Education Department with whom it is registered.
                    All
                    the major core subjects are offered, including isiZulu as a primary or as an additional language.
                    There has been a
                    pass rate of 100% in the National Senior Certificate Examination every year for the last twelve
                    years and a high
                    proportion of our pupils have gained a university entrance pass. Instruction is given in English and
                    the
                    academic achievement s are even greater when the fact is considered that for the majority of the
                    pupils this
                    language is not their mother tongue and they are writing all their examinations in it, except for
                    the other
                    languages that are studied. English as First Language is written by all pupils in the Senior
                    Certificate Exam.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Up until mid-2012 the school offered Grade R, which was fully registered with the Education
                    Department with a fully qualified Teacher. However, due to the low numbers of children attending, it
                    was decided by
                    the Governing Body to transfer the Grade R Class to local pre-primary schools in Underberg and
                    Himeville.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The small numbers in each age group, have made it difficult in the past to play schools in such
                    sports as rugby, soccer, cricket, netball and hockey, but as the school grows in size we have been
                    able to field more
                    teams in these sports, and now offer rugby, cricket, hockey, soccer, and netball, cross-country.
                    Individually, pupils have been selected for various district teams in athletics, soccer and rugby.
                    All of them have done
                    well.
                </p>
            
                The school takes part in many cultural and social activities and there are visits every quarter of
                speakers and shows of different kinds. Pupils regularly travel to plays, especially for their set works.
                <p>
                    As the school grows more and more parents in the district are coming to realise that it is no longer
                    necessary to send their children away to boarding school because there is a fully functioning high
                    school with
                    a sound academic record on their doorstep. It is a place where each boy or girl is encouraged to
                    strive to
                    reach his or her full potential, not only in the academic sphere but also in a wide range of
                    cultural and
                    sporting activities. We also try to inculcate civic awareness so that everyone learns to care for
                    others and
                    to show compassion for those in need. A large number of our own pupils fall into that last category
                    themselves having experienced our harsh life can be after the loss of both parents.
                </p>
