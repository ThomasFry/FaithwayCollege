            Vision
        </h2>

        <p>
            To provide quality education that will enable all learners to achieve their full potential regardless of
            their background, in a healthy and integrated environment
        </p>

                <h2>
            Mission
        </h2>

        <p>
            To provide a holistic education, which produces well rounded learners who are: courteous, aware of their
            social responsibilities, respect themselves and others , and who are able to reach their full potential in
            every field.
        </p>
        <p>
            We aim to inculcate the virtues of integrity and honesty within an academic, sporting, cultural and
            spiritual framework, developing the learners’ innate talents to the maximum.
        </p>

               <h2>
            Values
        </h2>

        <p>
            As a non-denominational Christian school, we hold as our core beliefs the values contained in the Bible and
            personified in Jesus Christ. As such our Constitution opens with our Statement of Faith which guides our
            major decisions in the school
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to the above, Faithway’s values closely reflect the values and principles of the South African
            Constitution and the NQF.
        </p>

        <p>
            Faithway values the community and as such we provide an education that addresses the needs of the community
            members (socially, financially and educationally)
        </p>

        <p>
            Our product is of value locally, nationally and internationally as learners receive the Dept. of Education’s
            National Senior Certificate which is accepted at institutions of high education
        </p>

        <p>
            We value all members of our community equally providing equal access to education for all sectors of the
            community, including disabled learners
        </p>
        <p>
            Our school seeks redress for many that are previously disadvantages through:
        <ol type 1>
            <li>Keeping school fees as low as possible</li>
            <li>Sourcing sponsorship from community members and NGO’s</li>
            <li>Having a school learner and educator body that is truly representative of SA cultural diversity</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The future of our learners is an important core principle and as such we provide subject-choice guidance at various key points in their education and endeavour to partner with a variety of Higher Education Institutions and business that can advise our learners
        </p>
        <p>
            We place a high premium on human dignity and self-esteem and thus the values of respect, kindness and generosity are actively fostered in our school environment
        </p>
